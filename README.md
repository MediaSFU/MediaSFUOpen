    ```

2. **Install Node.js 18.x:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```

4. **Allow OpenSSH through the firewall:**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    ```

5. **Enable the firewall:**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw --force enable
    ```

6. **Allow necessary ports through the firewall:**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 40000:49999/udp 
    sudo ufw allow 40000:49999/tcp
    sudo ufw allow http

    ```

10. **Install Certbot:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```

11. **Set up basic Nginx configuration:**

    Before obtaining SSL certificates, set up a basic Nginx configuration file. Replace `example.com` and `demo.example.com` with your domain details.

    ```nginx
    server {
        root /var/www/html;
        server_name example.com demo.example.com; #your domain details

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; #whatever port your app runs on
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; # Capture client's real IP
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # Capture client's forwarded IP(s)
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
    ```
12. **Obtain SSL certificates using Certbot:**

    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d example.mediasfu.com
    ```
13. **Set up Nginx configuration for SSL:**

    Create a new Nginx configuration file with the following content. Replace `example.com` and `demo.example.com` with your domain details.

    ```nginx
    server {
        root /var/www/html;
        server_name example.com demo.example.com; #your domain details

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; #whatever port your app runs on
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; # Capture client's real IP
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # Capture client's forwarded IP(s)
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

        listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    }

    server {
        if ($host = example.com) {
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        } # managed by Certbot

        listen 80;
        server_name example.com demo.example.com;
        return 404; # managed by Certbot
    }
    ```

14. **Install PM2 globally:**

    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```

15. **Edit the `index.js` file to specify your server's IP address:**

    Open the `index.js` file located in the root directory of your MediaSFUOpen installation.

    Find the section of code where the IP address is specified, usually near the beginning of the file.

    Change the IP address to your server's public IP address.

    Save the changes and close the file.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Change this line to your server's public IP address
    const ip = 'your_server_public_ip';
    ```

    Updating the IP address ensures that MediaSFUOpen binds to the correct network interface and listens on the appropriate IP address.
    
16. **üõ°Ô∏è Edit the `index.js` file to specify safe origins for secure Socket.IO Connections**

    To restrict Socket.IO connections to specific origins for enhanced security, follow these steps:


    Open the `index.js` file located in your Node.js application's directory.

    Find the section of code where the safe origins are specified.

    Add the origins you want to allow to the `safeOrigins` array.

    Save the changes and close the file.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Define safe origins
    const safeOrigins = [`https://localhost:${PORT}`];
    ```

    Replace with the origins you want to allow. You can add as many origins as needed to the array. Example const safeOrigins = ['https://subdomain.example.com']; 

16. **Start the MediaSFU application using PM2:**

    ```bash
    sudo pm2 start index.js
    ```

17. **Access the application:**

    You can access your MediaSFU application at `/meeting/start` on your domain. Starting a meeting is straightforward and easy. If you need help, refer to the [documentation](https://www.mediasfu.com/docs) for a guide and full feature access.

18. **Replace images and HTML files:**

    If needed, you can replace the images located in the `public` and `public_alt` folders with your own images. Additionally, update the HTML files in the project to match your brand.

19. **Maximum Participants:**

    MediaSFU recommends a maximum of 100 participants on HD or 200 on SD video.

Once the installation is complete, your MediaSFU application will be running with SSL enabled, providing a secure streaming environment.


## Running on Localhost

To run MediaSFU on localhost with SSL, follow these additional steps:

1. **Generate SSL Certificates:**

    Generate SSL certificates and paste them into the `local.com.key` and `local.com.pem` files located in the ssl folder of in the project directory.

2. **Run the Localhost Server:**

    Use the `index_localhost.js` file to run the server on localhost.

    ```bash
    npm start index_localhost.js
    ```

    Ensure that you access the application using `https` to utilize the SSL certificates.
